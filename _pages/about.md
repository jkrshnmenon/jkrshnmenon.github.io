I am a PhD student at [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) lab at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/).

I currently work at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu) with some really amazing people and my primary advisor is [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/).
I also actively work with [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/), [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/) and [Dr. Adam Doup√©](https://adamdoupe.com/).

My research focuses on automated vulnerability analysis on application software.
My areas of interest are static analysis, symbolic execution and fuzzing.

Prior to starting my PhD in Fall 2019, I had interned at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Christophe Hauser](https://bass.isi.edu/members/chris/) and at SEFCOM where I currently work as a Research Assistant.

I have also interned at [ForAllSecure Inc](https://forallsecure.com/) during the Summer 2022 and Summer 2023 where I worked with [Thanassis Avgerinos](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~aavgerin/) and many other amazing people.

I started playing CTF's as a part of [Team bi0s](https://bi0s.in/) in 2014 and I currently play with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) where I have been the co-captain since 2023.
I primarily focus on Pwning/Exploitation challenges, but I occasionally try out some Reverse Engineering challenges as well.

I am also a part of the Shellphish founded AIxCC team where we won $2 Million from DARPA as finalists in the [AIxCC competition](https://aicyberchallenge.com/) with our Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) [ARTIPHISHELL](https://support.shellphish.net/).
